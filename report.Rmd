## Introduction  
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 
In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).  

## Data Preprocessing  
First we load the needed libraries
```{r, cache = T, warning = FALSE}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)
library(corrplot)
```
### Download and Read the Data
After downloading the data from the data source, we can read the two csv files into two data frames.
```{r, cache = T}
trainUrl <-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
trainFile <- "./data/pml-training.csv"
testFile  <- "./data/pml-testing.csv"
if (!file.exists("./data")) {
  dir.create("./data")
}
if (!file.exists(trainFile)) {
  download.file(trainUrl, destfile=trainFile, method="curl")
}
if (!file.exists(testFile)) {
  download.file(testUrl, destfile=testFile, method="curl")
}
trainRaw <- read.csv("./data/pml-training.csv")
testRaw <- read.csv("./data/pml-testing.csv")
dim(trainRaw)
dim(testRaw)
```
The training data set contains 19622 observations and 160 variables, while the testing data set contains 20 observations and 160 variables. The "classe" variable in the training set is the outcome to predict. 

### Clean the data
We need to clean the data by getting rid of observations with missing values and some meaningless variables.
```{r, cache = T}
sum(complete.cases(trainRaw))
```
Removing columns that contain NA missing values.
```{r, cache = T}
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, colSums(is.na(trainRaw)) == 0] 
testRaw <- testRaw[, colSums(is.na(testRaw)) == 0] 
```  
Removing some columns that do not contribute much to the accelerometer measurements.
```{r, cache = T}
classe <- trainRaw$classe
trainRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(trainRaw))
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, !trainRemove]
trainCleaned <- trainRaw[, sapply(trainRaw, is.numeric)]
trainCleaned$classe <- classe
testRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(testRaw))
testRaw <- testRaw[, !testRemove]
testCleaned <- testRaw[, sapply(testRaw, is.numeric)]
```
Now, the cleaned training data set contains 19622 observations and 53 variables, while the testing data set contains 20 observations and 53 variables. The "classe" variable is still in the cleaned training set.

### Partitioning the data
We can split the cleaned training set into a pure training data set (70%) and a validation data set (30%). We will use the validation data set to conduct cross validation in future steps.
```{r, cache = T}
set.seed(15000) 
inTrain <- createDataPartition(trainCleaned$classe, p=0.70, list=F)
trainData <- trainCleaned[inTrain, ]
testData <- trainCleaned[-inTrain, ]
```

## Data Modeling
We'll use the **Random Forest** algorithm as a predictive model for activity recognition because it automatically selects important variables and is robust to correlate covariates & outliers in general. We'll also use **5-fold cross validation** when applying the algorithm.  
```{r, cache = T}
controlRf <- trainControl(method="cv", 5)
modelRf <- train(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method="rf", trControl=controlRf, ntree=250)
modelRf
```
Estimating the performance of the model on the validation data set as below.  
```{r, cache = T}
predictRf <- predict(modelRf, testData)
confusionMatrix(testData$classe, predictRf)
```
```{r, cache = T}
accuracy <- postResample(predictRf, testData$classe)
accuracy
oose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(testData$classe, predictRf)$overall[1])
oose
```
Estimated accuracy of the model is 99.30% and the estimated out-of-sample error is 0.69%.

## Predicting for Test Data Set
Now, we apply the model to the original testing data set downloaded from the data source. We remove the `problem_id` column first.  
```{r, cache = T}
result <- predict(modelRf, testCleaned[, -length(names(testCleaned))])
result
```
